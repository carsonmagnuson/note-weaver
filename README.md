# Note Weaver

A place to store notes for now, a place to weave novels in the future (hopefully).

## Inspiration

I got tired of using google docs to write stuff. And I didn't quite like what was already out there. I write a little differently than normal, I like to just jot down specific moments and quotes that I think of, and interweave them on the fly. Don't end up using outlines too frequently, so the plan is to make an app that can support that kind of writing style.

Plus I want to make a writing app that allows for vim motions.

## Current Progress

Idea for now is to create the minimum value product (MVP) - which consists of a two things.
- A create view, an edit view, and a listing view for 'piece' objects (notes) written in js using svelt
- A basic flask backend that hooks up to MongoDB
